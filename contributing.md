#### Joining in on the fun!
I've honestly never made one of these before, so I'll keep it short (for now). I've been away from MUSHing and MUSHCoding for a little while now, life, parenthood, education; Adulting.  When I came back, I noticed something, a big crowd of people with ideas for games, but a lack of places to play becaue of the techincal barrier - especially when it surrounds setup and coding - so I've started authoring some tools in my spare time to help ease a few of the pain points in the process.  **Mu-Format** is part one of an attempt to ease Softcode development (as much as you can, am I right? :D) and distribution with an **Open Source** mentality.

**Honestly, here's what I'm looking for:**

- **People willing to write/Update open source MUSHCode**. Plain and simple, this project won't work without you. I have ideas, but I'm only one person. If you have the power/patience to make code found on MUSHCode.com human readable? More power to you. Have ideas for a system you think others might get some enjoyment out of? Go for it! I'm working on tools to help transition pre-existing code easily into a Mu-Format friendly format through dbref swapping and what not.
- **Like minded web developers looking to work on Open Source MU utility projects**  I have a few projects in mind that I think would be fun to work with others on, plus I'm always open to ideas! Check out the source to Mu-Format on [Github](https://github.com/lcanady/mu-format) as it's the focus at the moment, but also look at the **Other Projects** Tab for a birds-eye view on what else I have in the pipeline - Or contact me and we can talk about projects!
- **Help with #tags!** I've written some basics, but I'd love to figure out other ways to ease the pain of MUSHCode authoring/reading/installation. Suggestions on shortcuts and automation areas would be cool!
- **Feedback. Lots and lots of feedback.**
