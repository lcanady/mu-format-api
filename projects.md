## Other Projects
#### Other things in the kitchen!

I'll flesh this page out more as I have more details on the projects, their individual sites/groups/archives/etc as they're worked on.  This list isn't in a particular order, but pretty close as I can see it.

- **Mu-Format Desktop** A tool to help create and test build Mu-Format archives before they're published to Github for consumption, and download and format code either locally or from an online archive.  You can either save the compiled code to a file, or use the installer client for a guided installation process.
