## Other Projects
#### Other things in the kitchen!

I'll flesh this page out more as I have more details on the projects, their individual sites/groups/archives/etc as they're worked on.  This list isn't in a particular order, but pretty close as I can see it.

### Mu-Format Desktop 
A tool to help create and test build Mu-Format archives before they're published to Github for consumption, and download and format code either locally or from an online archive.  You can either save the compiled code to a file, or use the installer client for a guided installation process.

### MuxBox
A web interface for MUX Installation, code management and other setup/administrative tasks (offsite Backups, etc.) through use of a bot as a game interface. it ill:
- Install Mux, and walk a user through initial setup through an included website.
- Act as an interactive interface for guided installation of Mu-Format code archives and their dependancies.

I could also see it offering:
- A Markdown powered replacement for MediaWiki included.  I'm not sure if this is a NextJS (Node/React) or Express/EJS (or other templating language) solution yet.

### UrsaMU
A Node JS powered MU server, webserver a RESTful (or GraphGl?) API, and Webhooks. I love MUX, but I don't love the usability of the technology. UrsaMU is my attempt to modernize the technology of the hobby I love so much!
